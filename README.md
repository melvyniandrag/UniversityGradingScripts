# Grading Scripts

Not sure how to do weighted grading of assignments / exams using blackboard at NJCU. So I download the grades as .csvs and run them through these little scrpits to compute final averages.

## HOW TO USE

do this in a terminal:

```
melvyn@computer$ python3 cs_202.py grade_data
```
